# Short Introduction about Bike Sharing Portfolio

A company operating in the field of bicycle rental services (traditional bicycles and modern bicycles) called "GowesKuyy" provides a bicycle lending service where the entire process of borrowing, membership and returning the bicycle is carried out automatically. Through this automatic system, customers can easily rent a bicycle from a certain location and return to another location. Due to the huge market interest in the automated system created by the GowesKuyy Company, there are already 500 bicycle rental programs throughout the world covering more than 500 bicycles.

To make it easier to distinguish active bicycle users, the GowesKuyy Company differentiates between 2 customers, casual customers, where casual customers are not registered as bicycle rental members, and registered customers which are the type of customers who are registered as bicycle renters, or in other words, registered customers are bicycle loan members.

Therefore, so that the data analysis process can be more focused, as a Data Analyst from the GowesKuyy Company, I created 5 questions. It is hoped that these five questions can make the analysis results a basis for the company to adopt a business strategy. The five business questions are:

1. What is the comparative level of bicycle lending years (2011 & 2012) based on the total number of loaned bicycle customers/users (both registered customers and casual customers) in each season?
2. What is the comparison of the frequency level of data values based on the percentage of bicycle users on weekdays and holidays?
3. What is the trend in time-series data regarding the use/borrowing of bicycles by both types of customers (registered customers & casual customers) during the borrowing time period based on working days and holidays?
4. What is the level or average number of bicycle users every day?
5. What is the trend in the level of bicycle borrowing from registered users and casual users based on date of use in each weather category?
